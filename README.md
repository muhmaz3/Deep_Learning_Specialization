course link: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

This is my personal source codes for the homework assignments. During the process of solving these assignments, I had lots of fun. I strongly recommend anyone who is interested in AI to take this specialization.

Lecturer: Andrew Ng, DeepLearning.ai

Below I just briefly describe what I have learned from this specialization.
### Course1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

### Course2: Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

### Course3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

### Course4: Convolutional Neural Networks

### Course5: Sequence Models
